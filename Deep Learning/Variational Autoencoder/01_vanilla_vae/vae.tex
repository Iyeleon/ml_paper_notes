\section*{PREFACE}
\indent \textit{Like many data scientists, my initial introduction to machine learning revolved around 
learning packages and understanding which functions to call to train a model. As a master's student 
applying machine learning to projects with tight deadlines, I somewhat accepted the black-box approach 
to understanding these models. Over the years, my priorities have shifted, and I now find myself eager 
to dissect the black boxes of AI to grasp the underlying mechanisms of the many models integrating into our 
lives.\\ \\
While older than many of the generative models available today, variational autoencoders [VAEs] have a 
particular charm. Whether it's their rigorous and detailed formulation or the wealth of information 
contained in related papers, VAEs and their subsequent families are as fascinating as they are 
intimidating. \\ \\
My first foray into VAEs involved running and modifying a hand-me-down code. After several rounds of 
training, it became clear that I was out of my depth and uncertain about which changes led to improvements 
or setbacks. After setting it aside for a while, I've finally returned to look under the hood and 
understand the intricacies of VAEs.\\}
